All the project files are uploaded in the git repository below.
You dont need any additional settings just download the zip or copy the link to run in android studio.

This is the project files section of the project.

Our instructions tell us to upload:
   
A. Assignment (all 3) 
B. Project Files 
C. Project Report (PDF) 
D. Demo Video (A demonstration video about your project ) 

A. we are attatching the link for all the assignments here only:
    https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1VaHTz6FjObAwSJv_ZYIYIa9TD9uR3e5L

   I have also created a folder in the same Git repo where i have uploaded all the 3 Assignments.

B. Project files are already uploaded as specified above.

C. Project Report is uploaded as PDF in the same Git Repository under the Project Report folder

D. Demovideo YouTube Link is as follows:
            [https://youtu.be/b_758USw6u8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_758USw6u8)
            the youtube video quality is not too good but it can serve the reason.

we could not upload the video for the same in our git repo because github doesn't allow more than 25MB but our video was 346MB.
